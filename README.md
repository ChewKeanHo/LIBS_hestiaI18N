# Hestia Libraries - `hestiaI18N`

[![Hestia Libraries](.src/logos/hestia_1200x270.svg)](#)

One Peaceful Frontend+Backend Software Library Suite.

This repository houses the operating components of the internationalization
(short for `i18n`) for various supported programming languages. The repository
splits itself into multiple parts depending on its language-specific or
deployment-specific usage.




## Why It Matters

This project was initiated primarily because of:

1. **Ensures proper interoperability between programming languages for i18n** -
   making sure the `hestiaI18N` library talks to each other seamlessly across
   programming languages.
2. **Adapting geo-political changes** - its data are related to geo-political
   changes which can be rapid, drastic, and sensitive.
3. **Simple to integrate** - simple enough to use the supported programming
   language's package manager.




## Setup

This libraries support multiple programming languages for the same dataset.
Hence, in order to use it, please import based on your deployed programming
language:
